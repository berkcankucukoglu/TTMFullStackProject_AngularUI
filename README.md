# FullStackProjectUI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.3.
This project contains the frontend codebase of my full-stack project called TinyTaskManager(TTM), using AngularJS. It encompasses the user interface components, client-side logic, routing configurations, and interactions with the backend API service.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
